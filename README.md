# EzForecast 🌦️

EzForecast is a simple weather forecast application built with **React + TypeScript**.  
It allows you to view current weather and a 3-day forecast for a selected city or based on your geolocation.  

This project was inspired by [Weather App on Roadmap.sh](https://roadmap.sh/projects/weather-app) and uses modern React patterns like props, useState, and lifted state.
